Recognizer for hand gestures for HackGT5

<T>Hand Gesture Recognizer</T>

Recognizer for Hand gestures, specifically 0, 1, or 2. Data used only for these three values to show proof of concept behind developing such an app, but applications are far and wide from being able to dynamically type with hands, to accessibility education for online classrooms.

In this app, the recognizer performs four simple functions: play, pause, go back, and skip by reading three hand gestures representing four states: pause is one, go back is zero, skip is two, and none of the previous represent an invalid state which is play.
